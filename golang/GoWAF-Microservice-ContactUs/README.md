This is single microservice from the Nlaak Studios Global Wealth & Freedom Blockchain Platform Project. I'm releasing the code here as a latest code sample as well as for other to learn from. Please keep in mind though that this code will not work by itself as it requires access to the GWF-Core Microservice which is not publically available.
You can however scan the code in full.
